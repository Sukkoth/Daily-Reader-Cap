For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself.\' And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, \'Save yourselves from this crooked generation.\' So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls."},{"book": "1 Peter 1:17-21", "text": "And if you call on him as Father who judges impartially according to each one\'s deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile, knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot. He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God."},{"book": "Luke 24:13-35", "text": "That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. But their eyes were kept from recognizing him... When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight. They said to each other, \'Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?\' And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, saying, \'The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!\' Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread."}]',

Although this is a stiff-necked people, forgive our wickedness and our sin, and take us as your inheritance.\' Then the Lord said: \'I am making a covenant with you.

If we are distressed, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer.
